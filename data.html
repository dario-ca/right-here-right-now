			</div>

			<h3>CTA busses data</h3>
			<p>The Chicago Transit Authority provides a <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/"> developer API</a> that allows third party applications to download near realtime data (usually they have a delay around 30 seconds).<br>
			In this application we used the <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/bustracker.aspx">bus tracker API</a>. In order to display realtime bus locations and stops for every bus the application needs to download the entire transport network and than display data only for the selected area. Since the API doesn't provide a filter based on the location of the bus every time the user selects an area the application will search in the entire network (using an efficient algorithm) for bus lines that have at least one stop inside the area. The creation of the network is a very slow process and for that reason we decided to save the precomputed network in a json file that is loaded when the application is launched.<br>
			For more informations please refer to the <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/developer_center/BusTime_Developer_API_Guide.pdf">ufficial documentation</a>.

			<h3>Divvy bikes data</h3>
			<p>The <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com">Divvybikes</a> provide a realtime API that is updated near realtime (every 30 seconds) and gives the information about every station (number of bikes that are at that station and number of available docks).<br>
			You can find the data in JSON format <a href="http://www.divvybikes.com/stations/json/">here</a>.

			<h3>Crimes and 311 data</h3>

			<h3>Restaurants and bars data</h3>
			<p>The <a href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation">Yelp developer API</a> is the main source of information for restaurants and bars. We also itegrated information about food inspection failed. In order to do it the application uses the 311 data and a special software componet execute the merge of the data based on location (we tried also ann association name based, but it doesn't work very well since restaurant name can be in different languages in 311 database and Yelp).</p>
